# Numerical-Analysis-for-Machine-LEarning-NAML-Notes
These notes contain the lecture materials for the course in Numerical Analysis for Machine Learning held at Polytechnic University of Milan for the Academic Year 2023-2024. These notes are a reworked version of the notes originally produced by Lorenzo Bozzoni. Some content has been removed, some added, and some has been modified. I am also providing a link to the original notes and to the GitHub profile of the original author.\\ \\
