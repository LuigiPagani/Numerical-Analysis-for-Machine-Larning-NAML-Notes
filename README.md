# Numerical Analysis for Machine Learning (NAML) Notes

These notes contain the lecture materials for the course in Numerical Analysis for Machine Learning held at Polytechnic University of Milan for the Academic Year 2023-2024. These notes are a reworked version of the notes originally produced by Lorenzo Bozzoni. Some content has been removed, some added, and some has been modified. I am also providing a link to the original notes and to the GitHub profile of the original author.
